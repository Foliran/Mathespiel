# Mathespiel
A little game we used to play during boring lessons at school
Rules:
1. Numbers from 1 to 19 are written in a row, except 10 since it is contains a zero
2. You may numbers that are the same or add up to ten.
3. You may cancel all numbers next to each other or numbers, that are connected by already canceled numbers, vertically, horizontally and into the next line.
4. The goal is to erase all numbers. 

Have fun!


(I think I just won this game only a handful of times, and I do not remember how I did it, so if you figured out a nice strategy, you have my respect!)
